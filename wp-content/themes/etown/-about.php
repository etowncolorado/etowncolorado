	    					The Owners of e|town all moved to the Vail Valley to pursue their love for the mountains and the accompanying lifestyle. Over the course of many years, and many careers, jobs, hobbies, days skiing, sports and activities, they met and recognized that they all shared a common goal. They all wanted to establish a restaurant that people could come to and feel like they were home. e|town strives to be a local watering hole that provides a place for the community to enjoy and gather after local events, to have a family meal, or to watch a favorite sporting game. e|town prides itself on providing a fun, comfortable space for everyone, especially our out of town guests, to enjoy excellent food at reasonable prices.

	    					After many discussions, the opportunity presented itself and we joined forces to open e|town in the spring of 2007.  Without you, we realize e|town would not exist, and so we strive to listen to our clients to provide the best experience possible.  As those of you that frequent our establishment know, we are always here and are accessible to your needs and wants.  Don't hesitate to ask questions or provide suggestions on how we can make your time with us better.  We have made Edwards and this wonderful valley our home, and hope that you continue to join us at e|town as we provide a "home away from home" for you.<br/>

							Thank you and see you soon!
